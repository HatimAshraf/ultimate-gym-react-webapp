# Ultimate Gym Web Application

This project is a **React.js** based web application designed to showcase key concepts of modern web development, including:

- **JSX** (JavaScript XML)
- **Props** (Passing data between components)
- **State** and **Hooks** (Managing component state and side effects)
- **Component-based Architecture** (Modular and reusable UI components)
- **Responsive Web Design** (Ensuring a seamless experience across devices)

Styling is handled using **TailwindCSS**, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with minimal custom styling.

## Features

- **State Management**: Leveraging React's state and hooks to manage component behavior and user interactions.
- **User Program Selection**: The app allows users to choose personalized workout programs based on their fitness goals. Users can explore various categories such as strength training, cardio, or flexibility, and select programs tailored to their preferences.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Ensuring that the web app functions smoothly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Styled with TailwindCSS**: Utilizing TailwindCSS for efficient styling and responsiveness without the need for custom CSS.
